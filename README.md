# AWS S3 Buckets-SEGA Story

Description

Overview

Created a training video addressing AWS S3 bucket security based on SEGA Europe’s real-world data exposure incident.

Scope

Just-in-Time Cybersecurity Awareness Content, designed to be practical, timely, minimally invasive and accessible to the wide scope of the organization’s personnel with the aspiration of helping individuals to how they can relate to and embrace with the content personally.

Example Contrast:

“Do this because it’s for the good of the business…” and the end user might not care.

vs.

“Do this because it will protect your personal finances [or] it can protect your loved ones…” and the end user is much more likely to hear what it is that is attempted to be conveyed.

For instance…

“Here’s what Multi-Factor Authentication is.  I’d strongly encourage that you put it on your financial accounts & your e-mail accounts, because bad guys can get your password and they can log in & drain your bank accounts.”

Key Points

Risk Highlight: SEGA’s misconfigured S3 bucket incident underscores the common risk of leaks.

Incident Impact:  Examined real-world consequences, including exposed API keys, messaging systems, and user data.

Best Practices: Shared insights on securing AWS S3 buckets and promoting responsible disclosure.

Objectives

Raise awareness about AWS S3 security risks.

Highlight real-world impact with SEGA case study.

Encourage best practices and responsible disclosure in the cybersecurity community.

Project Walk-Through

Step 1: Identifying the Opportunity

Between threat modeling and keeping up to date with current cybersecurity news, I chose to use a real-world occurrence as an opportunity for security awareness training within my organization.  I selected the SEGA data breach incident (Read more) as a case study.



Understanding the ramifications of this real-world event, I identified the people within my organization who would benefit from learning about this event from a security perspective.  In this case, anyone who uses cloud storage, specifically AWS.

Step 2: Develop the Outline

In order to properly educate these individuals, I developed an outline to guide how I would provide the education:

Make the people within my organization understand the risk associated with AWS S3 buckets, and support them in understanding it.

Emphasize the risk of insecure AWS S3 buckets.

Educate them on how to secure AWS S3 buckets properly.

Step 3: Create the Video Content

I created a short video addressing the risks associated with AWS S3 Buckets.  Check it out below:



Step 4: Communication via E-Mail

To disseminate this message, I sent out an e-mail containing a link to the video:



Step 5: Repeating the Process

I would repeat steps 1 through 4 by creating more security awareness training content, typically once a week; depending on the needs of the company, this is clearly a flexible scheduling.
